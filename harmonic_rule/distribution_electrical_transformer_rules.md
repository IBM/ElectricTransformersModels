# Distribution Electrical Transformer Alarm Rules



### Winding Temperature Rise

**Unit**: Celsius

**Limits**:
- Upper Limit: 65°C

**Problem**:
When the transformer is at its nameplate rating, the transformer temperature rise is the average temperature increase of the windings above the ambient temperature. This increase in temperature has the potential to shorten the transformer's lifespan.

**Description**:
For 30ºC average ambient temperature conditions, the temperature of the cooling air (ambient temperature) does not exceed 40ºC (104ºF), and the average temperature of the cooling air for any 24 hours does not exceed 30ºC. Instrument transformers may also be rated for 55ºC ambient temperature for use inside the enclosed switchgear, provided the ambient temperature of the cooling air on the inside of enclosed switchgear does not exceed 55ºC. See ANSI Std. C37.20, “Switchgear Assemblies including Metal-Enclosed Bus,” and NEMA Std. SG5, “Power Switchgear Assemblies,” for further information.

### Voltage to BIL

**Unit**: Continuous

**Limits**:
- Upper Limit: 150

**Problem**:
Voltages over the Basic Insulation Level (BIL) will cause damage to the transformer's insulation eventually leading to heat loss and lower transformer performance.

**Description**:
Insulation values above this level for the lines and equipment in the system must be so coordinated that specific protective devices operate satisfactorily below that minimum level. See reference: [Electrical Engineering Portal](https://electrical-engineering-portal.com/definition-basic-insulation-level-bil).

### Transformer KVA Rating

**Unit**: kVA

**Limits**:
- Upper Limit: 150

**Problem**:
Exceeding the transformer's KVA rating can lead to overloading, voltage drop, increased energy losses, and safety hazards.

**Description**:
The kVA rating of a single-phase regulator is the product of its rated load amperes and its rated range of regulation in kilovolts. For polyphase regulators, this product has to be multiplied by the appropriate phase factors (1.732 for three-phase regulators).

### Oil Overheating

**Unit**: Celsius

**Limits**:
- Upper Limit: 130°C

**Problem**:
Oil overheating in a transformer can lead to reduced insulation, shortened lifespan, reduced efficiency, and safety hazards.

**Description**:
The primary functions of oil in a transformer are insulation and cooling for the transformer's core and windings.

### Oil Overcooling

**Unit**: Celsius

**Limits**:
- Lower Limit: -30°C

**Problem**:
Oil overheating in a transformer can lead to reduced insulation, shortened lifespan, reduced efficiency, and safety hazards.

**Description**:
The primary functions of oil in a transformer are insulation and cooling for the transformer's core and windings.

### Ambient Temperature Overload

**Unit**: Celsius

**Limits**:
- Upper Limit: 65°C

**Problem**:
When the transformer is at its nameplate rating, an increase in temperature has the potential to shorten the transformer's lifespan.

**Description**:
A standard transformer with 220°C insulation and a 150°C temperature rise will be rated to run full load in an average 30°C ambient environment over 24 hours with a maximum 40°C ambient temperature.

### Harmonic Distortion

**Unit**: Harmonic Distortion (Percentage)

**Limits**:
- Upper Limit: 5.0%

**Problem**:
High voltage THD can cause a variety of problems in power systems, including -
- Reduced efficiency and overheating of transformers, leading to a shorter lifespan.
- Interference with sensitive electronic equipment, causing malfunctions or reduced performance.

**Description**:
Voltage Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) in the context of transformers refers to the distortion of the voltage waveform due to the presence of multiple harmonic frequencies in addition to the fundamental frequency. In power systems, the fundamental frequency is typically 50 or 60 Hz, depending on the region. Harmonics are integer multiples of this fundamental frequency, and they can be generated by non-linear loads or devices connected to the power system, such as power electronics or electric arc furnaces.

### Current Limit

**Unit**: kA

**Limits**:
- Upper Limit: 10 kA

**Problem**:
Overloading a transformer can cause overheating and reduced efficiency.

**Description**:
Current limits in a transformer refer to the maximum amount of electrical current that the transformer can safely handle without overheating, degrading its insulation, or causing other forms of damage.

### Water Content

**Unit**: ppm

**Limits**:
- Upper Limit: 50 ppm

**Problem**:
Elevated water content levels in transformer oil can cause the breakdown of cellulose insulation, lead to the formation of gases, and indicate high-temperature operation or environmental conditions causing degradation of the oil and other materials.

**Description**:
Water content in Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is one of the parameters that is analyzed in transformer oil to assess the condition of electrical equipment.
